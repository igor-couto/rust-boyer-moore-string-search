# Boyer-Moore String Search in Rust

This repository contains an implementation of the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm in Rust. The algorithm performs an efficient search for a pattern within a given text.

## Description

The Boyer-Moore algorithm is an efficient string searching algorithm that skips sections of the text to be searched, resulting in a lower constant factor than many other string algorithms in practice. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm)

The algorithm is implemented in Rust, utilizing its systems programming capabilities and robust type system.

## Features

- Efficient string searching
- Implementation in safe Rust
- Unit tests for verifying functionality

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the code with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igor-couto/rust-boyer-moore-string-search
cd rust-boyer-moore-string-search
cargo run
```

To run the unit tests:
```bash
cargo test
```
